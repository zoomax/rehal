      There are many problems that face us when going to a new place in any
      province or city, and one of the most common of these problems is the lack
      of knowledge of this place and the consequent lack of knowledge of the
      best places and services in it, which is the closest and how to reach it.
      And when we use the Google platform to know the assessment of places to
      make the best choice, we find that this evaluation is made by the owners
      of the places and therefore we cannot know which is better for the
      personal experience. We also face problems with the Google Maps
      application when using it to choose a place and go to it, especially in
      Egypt, due to the permanent change in the terrain of the road and the
      similar designations for most places, an example of this is the presence
      of more than one petrol in Egypt bearing the name of the cooperation
      gasoline and other such examples ...... Based on that, we came up with the
      idea of making this project "mobile application and web page" to help
      people choose the best city or place that can be visited through a
      detailed presentation of this city in ter.... ms of: its tourist
      attractions, its nature, social and entertainment services, in addition to
      evaluating these places, but by people, those who visited it personally
      and that help people choose the best place and reach easily through
      detailed maps.
